  Finally, we need to define another structure that will represent the total quantity available at the best bid and ask prices. This will 
  represent the best (most aggressive) buy and sell prices available in the market as well as the sum of the quantities of all the orders 
  at those prices. This structure, called BBO, only has four members â€“ bid_price_ and ask_price_ (both Price types to represent the 
  best prices), and bid_qty_ and ask_qty_ to represent the total quantity of all orders at these prices.

  The BBO abstraction is used by many different components inside the trade engine. Typically, this is used by components that need 
  a summary of the best market prices and liquidity, instead of the full depth of the book and all the details about each order in the 
  book. For example, a component such as the RiskManager component, which only needs to compute the open Profit and Loss (PnL) 
  for an open position when the top-of-book prices change, does not need access to the full order book and instead can be 
  simplified using a BBO abstraction. Other components, such as FeatureEngine, PositionKeeper, LiquidityTaker, and MarketMaker, also use 
  the BBO abstraction where the full order book is not needed
