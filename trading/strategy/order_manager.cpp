   /*
   Like the newOrder() method, we must initialize an MEClientRequest client_request object of the ClientRequestType::CANCEL
   type and populate the attributes in it from the OMOrder object that was passed into the method. It calls 
   the TradeEngine::sendClientRequest() method.to send the cancel request out. One thing to understand is that the next_order_id_ 
   member variable is only used for generating new order IDs for new outgoing order requests. Cancelling an existing order does not 
   change the next_order_id_ variable, as shown in the following code block. In our design, next_order_id_ keeps incrementing sequentially 
   each time we send an MEClientRequest of the ClientRequestType::NEW type. 
   
   ===================================================================================================================
   Theoretically, we could reuse the order_id_ value from the order we just cancelled on the next new order request, but that would 
   require us to track the free order IDs, which is not too difficult either. This was just a design choice we made, but feel free 
   to modify this scheme and track free order IDs if you wish
