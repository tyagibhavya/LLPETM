        Qty_INVALID respectively) since the side is empty. The more interesting handling is in the case where the bids_by_price_ member is valid.
        In that case, we set the bid_price_ member variable in the bbo_ object to be the price of the best bid: bids_by_price_->price_. To compute bid_qty_ in the bbo_ object, 
        we first assign it qty_ of the first order at that price level, which we access using the bids_by_price_->first_mkt_order_->qty_ value. Then, we linearly iterate over all 
        the orders at that price level by following the next_order_ pointers until we wrap around, i.e. the next_order_ points to the first_mkt_order_ object. For each order we 
        iterate over, we accumulate the qty_ value of that order into the bid_qty_ member in our bbo_ object. At this point, we are done updating the bid side of the BBO object
